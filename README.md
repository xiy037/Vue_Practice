# Vue_Practice

## component-practice
In component-practice, a `taskList` app containing multiple components was created. the TaskList was stored in `db.json`, which you need to employ `json-server` for app to access.

## router-practice
In router-practice, vue-router was added in dependencies. 
A shopping cart was used as example here.
router-practice did not install vuex, so event was handled by emiting event/data to eventHub or through parent/child components.

## vuex-demo
This demo shows syntax for vuex.
